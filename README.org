* Introduction

  A Virtual Labs /Experiment/ is a systematic collection of learning
  resources for Engineering students to learn about a single topic in
  a subject.  Each experiment consists of some theory and reading
  material, interactive simulations and quizes or tests.  The
  authoring process may be different for each institute but the end
  result is a collection of web-pages that are published together as
  an /Experiment/.

  Each experiment is a part of of /Lab/.  A /Lab/ is a conceptually a
  collection of /Experiments/ related to a subject.  A /Lab/ is
  published as a collection of web-pages that provide an entry point
  for a user to learn about that subject.  The list of experiments
  included in a lab provides links to all the available experiments.

  Creating a publishable lab along with all it's experiments, is a
  process that involves a lot of manual effort that does not add any
  value to the lab itself.  *Labgen* is a command-line tool that helps
  in avoiding all the repeatative effort involved in creating a lab
  from individual experiments and other lab content.

  The following processes are supported by *labgen*:
  1. Generation of Lab pages.
  2. Deployment of Lab
  3. Build and Deployment of Experiments

  The automated build and deployment of experiments is supported only
  for experiments generated using the /Phase 3 experiment authoring
  process/ (link?) defined by IIT-B.
  

* Requirements
  
  1. *node 12.12.x*
     - Download link: [[https://nodejs.org/en/download/][node]]
     - recommended to install via [[https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm][nvm]]
  2. *npm 6.11.x*


* Setup

** Install Dependencies

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash

   npm install
   
   #+END_SRC

  
* Generating Lab Pages
  
** Create Lab Repository

   Create a new lab repository on [[https://github.com/virtual-labs][Github]] or clone and existing one.
   The repository should be empty.

** Initialize Lab Descriptor

   To start with the process of lab generation, you need a /Lab
   Descriptor/.

   /Lab Descriptor/ is a json file the contains data for lab pages and
   other information for lab and experiment deployment.  [[file:lab-descriptor.org][This]] document
   describes the structure of a lab descriptor file.

   
** Complete and Verify Lab Descriptor

   Fill all the values in the =<path/to/lab/repo>/lab-descriptor.json=
   file generated above and create a pull-request to get the
   lab-descriptor approved.

   
*** LD Verification Example

    Continuing the [[Init Example][init]] example, lets see how to submit the completed
    lab-descriptor for verification.

    In the lab repository, switch to a new branch and edit the json.

    #+BEGIN_SRC bash
    cd ~/virtual-labs/myNewLab
    git checkout -b lab-descriptor
    editor lab-descriptor.json
    #+END_SRC

    After filling the json push the file to remote and create a pull
    request.

    #+BEGIN_SRC bash
      git add lab-descriptor.json
      git commit -m "lab-descriptor for verification"
      git push origin lab-descriptor
    #+END_SRC

    Once this pull request is merged to master, do not make any new
    changes to the lab-descriptor.


** Run All

   From the /Phase-3-Lab-Template/ repository, run the following.
   
   #+NAME: labgen-generate
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     npm run labgen -- --release minor <path/to/lab/repo>
   #+END_SRC


* Building an Experiment

To build an individual experiment first clone the experiment and run
the following:


#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cd <path/to/experiment/repo>
git clone https://github.com/virtual-labs/ph3-lab-mgmt/
cd ph3-lab-mgmt
npm install
npm run build-exp ../
#+END_SRC

Or, from with this repository:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
npm run build-exp <path/to/exp/repo>
#+END_SRC

The first method is useful when running the script from the github
actions pipeline.

The experiment can be found in the =build= directory with the
experiment repository location.
