#+TITLE: Lab Build Process

* Introduction
This document describes the lab build process.

* Process
  
** Generate Pages
   
   [[file:page-generation.png][file:page-generation.png]]
   
*** Assumptions
- There exists a git repository for the lab.
- The lab repository is available on the machine that runs this
  script.
- The lab repository has a remote (usually on
  https://github.com/virtual-labs/)
- The lab repository has a =master= branch.
- There exists a =lab-descriptor.json= in the lab repository.
- Experiment repositories (and tags) exist and follow the provided
  experiment [[https://github.com/virtual-labs/ph3-exp-template/][template]].


*** Dependencies
    - Template :: The template html file that defines the common
                  skeleton for all pages.
    - Config :: This contains information about which pages are
                generated using which templates.
    - Lab Descriptor :: This is a json document that contains all the
                        lab related data.  This should be present in
                        the lab repository, on the master branch.
    - Page Templates :: Each page in the lab is generated using the
                        top level skeleton and a page specific
                        template.  The data for the page specific
                        template comes from the lab descriptor.  All
                        the page templates are placed in a directory
                        called =page-templates=.

*** Generating Components
    The components are generated using templates.  Templates are found
    in the [[file:page-templates][page-templates]] directory.

    The =page-templates= directory contains [[https://handlebarsjs.com/][handlebarsjs]] templates.
    Each of these templates is one of two types:
    - Page Specific Template :: Page specific templates are defined
         for components that are required in a single page.
    - Common Template :: Common Templates are used to generate
         components like headers, footers etc. that are placed in each
         page.

**** Difference Between IIITH and Other Lab pages
     The IIITH lab pages are similar to all other lab pages, except
     for the List of Experiments Page.  The list of experiments page
     has different template for the two types of experiments.

     - Template for IIITH Labs :: nested-list-of-experiments-ctnt.handlebars
     - Template for Other Labs :: list-of-experiments-ctnt.handlebars
     
     As the templates are different, the data also comes from
     different fields in the lab-descriptor.

     - IIITH Lab List of Experiments Field :: =experiments=
     - Other Lab List of Experiments Field :: =nested-experiments=

     Only one of these fields should be present in a lab-descriptor.

     *NOTE*: If both fields are present, the lab pages will not be
     generated.

*** Generate Lab

    Once the pages are generated (generated pages are present in
    =page-components=) the lab is generated using the following:

    - Page Components :: Page Components are the html pages generated
         using the data and templates.

    - assets :: the css, js, images and fonts are taken from
                =templates/assets= directory.
   
** Build and Stage Experiments

   [[file:deployment-process.jpg][file:deployment-process.jpg]]
   
   After the lab pages are built, the experiments need to built and
   staged.

** Stage Lab
   
   If the build and staging process of experiments is successful, we
   move on to the process of staging the lab.

   Here we basically just copy the contents of the =build= directory
   from the labpath to the staging location, which is a directory on
   the server.
   
** Deploy

   If the staging of experiments and lab sources succeeds the last
   step is to place the lab sources and the experiments to their final
   location on the server.

   *NOTE*: We assume that is process is not prone to any known errors.

** Release Management

   After each successful lab generation and deployment process, the
   lab sources are pushed to its repository along with the timestamp
   in its commit message.

   A new release of the sources is made by incrementing the previous
   release number.  The numbering scheme follows semantic versioning.
   The type of release determines the version number.
   
   
*** Version scheme

    Every release follows the scheme : =v<X>.<Y>.<Z>=. Where X, Y, and
    Z are non-negative integers.

    Types of releases:
    - Major :: X is incremented and Y, Z become 0.
    - Minor :: X stays the same.  Y is incremented and Z becomes 0.
    - Patch :: X and Y remain the same.  Z is incremented.

* Reporting

   The timestamp, verion number and status (success or failure) of the
   run is updated to a [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Z-acT5GKrna_JyHanxq3mXKocRPUb1KPL8vY7mKa5KA/edit#gid=0][google sheet]].

* Descriptor Validation

  The lab descriptor is validated using a [[file:~/iiith/vlead/Phase-3-Lab-Template/labDescSchema.json][schema]].  If anything is
  invalid in the lab descriptor, the error is displayed and process
  aborts.
